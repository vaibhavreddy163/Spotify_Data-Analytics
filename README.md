# Spotify Data Analytics Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Spotify Data Analytics project! This project aims to analyze and derive insights from a dataset containing Spotify music data. It includes various data analysis and machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and building a music recommendation system.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into several key tasks:

### Data Collection
- The initial step involves obtaining a dataset of Spotify music tracks, which includes information about the songs, artists, and audio features.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, format data, and prepare it for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Exploring the dataset to gain insights into music trends, artist prevalence, audio feature distributions, and more.

### Predictive Modeling
- Building machine learning models to predict song popularity based on audio features and other attributes.

### Recommendation System
- Implementing a music recommendation system, allowing users to discover new songs based on their preferences.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [provide source/link if available]. It contains information about songs, artists, and various audio features such as danceability, valence, energy, and more.

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset and any generated data files
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and recommendation system
- **README.md**: This README file

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavreddy163/spotify-data-analytics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd spotify-data-analytics
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In the **scripts/** directory, you will find Python scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset. You can run these scripts to prepare the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset and visualize trends by running Jupyter notebooks in the **notebooks/** directory.

## Predictive Modeling
Build predictive models for song popularity using machine learning techniques. Refer to the notebooks in the **notebooks/** directory for modeling details.

## Recommendation System
Implement a music recommendation system in Python. You can find the recommendation system script in the **scripts/** directory.

## Usage
To use the project for your analysis, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.

2. Clean and preprocess the data using the provided scripts or customize them for your dataset.

3. Explore the data and perform analysis using the Jupyter notebooks.

4. Build predictive models or recommendation systems based on your project goals.
